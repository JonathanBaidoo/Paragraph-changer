            In considering any new subject, there is frequently a tendency, first, to overrate what we 
            find to be already interesting or remarkable; and, secondly, by a sort of natural reaction, 
            to undervalue the true state of the case, when we do discover that our motions have surpassed those
            that were really tenable at least.
